## Setup

- .content-box-purple[.font80[Two groups:]] 

    - `\(D_i=1\)` Treated units
    
    - `\(D_i=0\)` Control units

- .content-box-purple[.font80[Two periods:]] 

    - `\(T_i=1\)` Pre-Treatment period 
    
    - `\(T_i=0\)` Post-Treatment period

- .content-box-purple[.font80[Potential outcome:]] 

    - `\(Y_{i}^1(t)\)` outcome of unit `\(i\)` in period `\(t\)` when treated (at `\(D_i = 1\)`)

    - `\(Y_{i}^0(t)\)` outcome of unit `\(i\)` in period `\(t\)` when control (at `\(D_i = 0\)`)
    
---

## Setup

.content-box-purple[.font80[Causal effect for unit `\(i\)` at time `\(t\)` is:]] 

- `\(\tau_i(t) = Y_{i}^1(t) - Y_{i}^0(t)\)`

For a given unit, in a given time period, the observed outcome `\(Y_{i}(t)\)` is:

-  `\(Y_{i}(t) = Y_{i}^1(t)\times D_i(t) + Y_{i}^0(t)\times (1-D_i(t))\)`

-  If treatment occurs only after `\(t= 0\)` we have:

`$$Y_{i}(1) = Y_{i}^0(1)\times (1-D_i) + Y_{i}^1(1)\times D_i$$`

--&gt; Fundamental problem of causal inference.

.content-box-purple[.font80[Estimand (ATT)]]: `\(\hat \tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{i}^1(1) - Y_{i}^0(1)|D_i = 1]\)`

**Missing potential outcome: `\(E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1]\)`, ie. what is the average post-period outcome for the treated in the absence of the treatment?**

## Identification Assumptions


&lt;br /&gt;

- Parellel trends

If treated units did not receive the treatment, they would have followed the same trend as the control units --&gt; Trend over time is the same for treatment and control.

- No time-varying confounders --&gt; Selection bias is stable over time

Omitted variables related both to treatment and outcome must be fixed over time

---

.content-box-purple[.font80[Estimand (ATT)]]: `\(\hat \tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{i}^1(1) - Y_{i}^0(1)|D_i = 1]\)`

.content-box-purple[.font80[Identification Assumption]] 

- `\(E[Y_{i}^0(1) - Y_{i}^0(0)|D_i = 1] = E[Y_{i}^0(1) - Y_{i}^0(0)|D_i = 0]\)`

.content-box-purple[.font80[Identification Result]] 

`$$\begin{aligned}
E[Y_{i}^1(1) - Y_{i}^0(1)|D_i = 1] &amp; = E[Y_{i}^1(1)|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i}^0(1)|D_i = 1]  \\
&amp; = E[Y_{i}^1(1)|D_i = 1] - \{E[Y_{i}^0(0)|D_i = 1]  \\
&amp; + E[Y_{i}^0(1)|D_i = 0] - E[Y_{i}^0(0)|D_i = 0]\}  \\
&amp; = \{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i}(1)|D_i = 0]\}  \\
&amp; - \{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{i}(0)|D_i = 0]\}
\end{aligned}$$`

In other words:

`\(\hat \tau_{ATT}\)` = {Difference in means in post-treatment period} - {Difference in means in pre-treatment period}

---

## Regression DD

Alternatively, the same estimator can be obtained using regression techniques

`$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \times D_i + \beta_2 \times T_i + \delta \times (D_i \times T_i) + \varepsilon$$`

where `\(E[\varepsilon |D_i, T_i] = 0\)` Then, it is easy to show `\(E[Y_i| {D_i, T_i}]\)` in the following table

|  |  `\(T_i = 0\)` |  `\(T_i = 1\)` | After - Before| 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |  :--- |  
| `\(D_i = 0\)`  | `\(\alpha\)`  | `\(\alpha + \beta_2\)`  | `\(\beta_2\)`  | 
| `\(D_i = 1\)`  | `\(\alpha + \beta_1\)` | `\(\alpha + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \delta\)` | `\(\beta_2 + \delta\)` | 
| Treated - Control  | `\(\beta_1\)` | `\(\beta_1 + \delta\)` | `\(\delta\)` | 

Thus, the difference-in-differences estimate is given by: `\(\hat \tau_{ATT} = (\beta_2 + \delta)- \beta_2 = \delta\)`

Equivalently: `\(\hat \tau_{ATT} = (\beta_1 + \delta)- \beta_1 = \delta\)`

---

## Cross-Sectional Regression Estimator

A nice feature of diff-in-diff is that it does not require panel data, i.e. repeated observations of the same units. But it's also possible to use repeated cross-sections:

- `\(Y_{igt}\)` where unit `\(i\)` is only measured at one `\(t\)`

- Units fall into treatment based on groups `\(g\)`

- Particularly useful as many "treatments" vary at some aggregate level:

    - e.g. Law changes at the state/region level
    
---

## Cross-Sectional Regression Estimator

Two options:

.content-box-purple[.font80[Individual-level data:]] 

`$$Y_{igt} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times D_{g(i)} + \beta_2 \times T_{t(i)} + \delta \times (D_{g(i)} \times T_{t(i)}) + \varepsilon_{igt}$$`

.content-box-purple[.font80[Aggregated data:]] 

`$$Y_{gt} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times D_g + \beta_2 \times T_t + \delta \times (D_g \times T_t) + \varepsilon_{gt}$$`

Both approaches will give the same result, as the treatment only varies at the group level (so long as the aggregated version is weighted by cell size).

---

## Regression Estimator Advantages

- Easy to calculate standard errors (though be careful about clustering)

- We can control for other variables

    - Individual-level data, group-level treatment: controlling for individual covariates may increase precision
    
    - Time-varying covariates at the group-level may strengthen the parallel trends assumption, but beware of post-treatment bias

- Simple to extend to multiple groups/periods (more on this later)

- Possible to use multi-valued (not just binary) treatments

---

## First Differences Estimator

&lt;br \&gt;

With panel data we can use regression with first differences:

$$\Delta Y_{i} = \alpha + \delta \times D_i + X_i^{'} \beta + \mu, $$

where `\(\Delta Y_{i} = Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)\)`.

&lt;br \&gt;

With two periods it gives identical result as other regressions

---

## Threats to Validity

- Non-parallel trends

    - Critical identification assumption: treatment units have similar trends to control units in the absence of treatment.
    
    - This assumption is however untestable because we cannot observe potential outcome under the control condition for treated units in the post-treatment period.
    
- Potential violations of parallel trends

    - “Ashenfelter’s Dip”: Participants in worker training programs may experience decreased earnings before they enter the program (why are they participating?)
    
    - Targeting: Policymakers may target units who are most improving
    
    
---

## Threats to Validity

.content-box-purple[.font80[Assessing (non-)parallel trends]] 

- One treatment/control group

    - Plot results and look at trends in periods before the treatment
    
    - Is the parallel trends assumption plausible?

- Multiple treatment/control comparisons

    - Estimate treatment effects at different time points (i.e. placebo tests) --&gt; All estimated treatment effects before the treatment should be 0.
    
    - Include unit-specific time trends --&gt; ‘relax’ parallel trends assumption

&lt;/div&gt;


---

## Fixed-Effect Estimator

We can generalise to multiple groups/time periods using unit and period fixed-effects (‘two-way’ fixed-effect model):

`$$Y_{it} = \gamma_i + \alpha_t + \delta D_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}$$`

- `\(\gamma_i\)` is a fixed-effect for groups (dummy for each group)

- `\(\alpha_t\)` is a fixed-effect for time periods (dummy for each time period)

- `\(\delta\)` is the diff-in-diff estimate based on `\(D_{it}\)`, which is 1 for treated unit-period observations, and 0 otherwise

This is very flexble:

- can replace `\(D_{it}\)` with almost any type of treatment (not only binary)

- can extend easily to multiple periods (i.e. more than 2)

- can have different units treated at different times

---

## Why Fixed-Effect Estimator?

- Unit/group FEs mean that we are only using within group variation in Y to calculate the effect of D

    - Removes any omitted variable bias that is constant over time
    
- Time FEs means that we remove the effect of any changes to the outcome variable that affect all units at the same time

    - `\(\hat \delta \rightarrow \hat \tau_{ATT}\)`

- Note that unit dummies lead to smaller standard errors on our treatment effect. Why not always use unit dummies?

    - Fine in panel data, as we have same units at several points in time

    - Not possible with repeated cross-section when we do not have the
same units in each time period


---

## Standard Errors for DiD

- Many papers using a DiD strategy use data from many periods

- Treatments typically vary at the group level, while outcomes normally measured at the individual level

    - E.g. Minimum wage increases (state-level) and employment data (firm-level) in Card and Krueger (1994)
    
- This will not bias treatment effect estimates, but will cause problems for variance estimation when errors are serially correlated

- Implication: traditional standard errors will tend to be too small.

---

## Standard Errors for DiD

.content-box-purple[.font80[Solution (Bertrand et al (2004))]] 

Use cluster-robust standard errors where clusters are defined at the level of the treatment. If the number of groups is:

- ...large (more than 30), use vcovCL in sandwich
- ...small (less than 30), use block-bootstrap

---

## Data Requirements for DiD

.content-box-purple[.font80[Data structure:]] 


- Panel data or repeated cross-section

- Single or multiple treatments

- Continuous or binary treatments

- Works both at individual/aggregate level


.content-box-purple[.font80[Does this require more data?]] 


- Adding a time dimension can increase the amount of data you need

- No need to control for extensive covariates (so long as they are fixed within units over time) which might mean decreased data collection

## Examples of DiD Design

**[Bechtel &amp; Heinmueller, 2011](https://web.stanford.edu/~jhain/Paper/AJPS2011.pdf)**

- RQ: What is the effect of good policy on government support?

**[Hainmueller &amp; Hangartner, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12433)**

- RQ: What is the effect of direct democracy on immigrant assimilation?

- Outcome: Naturalization rate of immigrants in Swiss municipalities

- Treatment: Whether municipality decides on naturalisation requests via expert or citizen councils

- Time: Decisions before/after legal changes to decision making in municipalities

---

## Conclusion

- The DiD design allows for a comparison over time in the treatment group, controlling for concurrent time trends using a control group.

- DiD requires data on multiple units in multiple periods, but can be applied to panel data or repeated cross-sectional data.

- DiD is very widely used, as it is a powerful conditioning strategy that doesn’t require endless lists of covariates to strengthen the identifying assumption.

- The identification assumption that treatment and control units would follow parallel trends in the absense of treatment is key and should be investigated carefully.
