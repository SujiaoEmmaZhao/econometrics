# Stata Command Syntax

[prefix :] command [varlist] [=exp] [if] [in] [weight] [using filename]
                           [, options]
                           
<br />                           

Elements in square brackets are optional. 
“varlist” is a list of variable names, 
“command” is a Stata command,
“exp” is an algebraic expression, 
“if” and “in”  define a range of observations, 
“weight”  is a weighting expression, 
“filename” is a filename and 
“options” are options allowed by the particular command. 

The optional “prefix” invokes Stata prefix commands

<br />

**You can always find the correct syntax for a command by typing help followed by the command name.**

# Stata Command Syntax

#### Examples of Stata Commands
```{r eval=FALSE}
use auto, clear
describe
list make if price>1000
list make in 1/10
summarize price, detail 
correlate mpg weight price length displ
sort foreign
by foreign: summarize price mpg
```


--

For most commands that require “*varlist*”, if you do not specify it, it is assumed that you want all variables [the system variable “*_all*”]. 

You can use wildcards (*) and abbreviations to refer to variables (and to cmdnames).

# Stata Command Syntax

#### Examples of Stata Commands

```{r eval=FALSE}
u auto, clear
d
l ma if  p>1000
l ma in 1/10
su p, d
cor mp w p l d
so f
by f: su p mp
```

--

**Very Important: ** Stata is case-sensitive. The variables “price”, “Price” and “PRICE” are all different. 

**Reserved Names** e.g., “_all”, “_b”, “_cons”,” _n”, “_N”, “_pi”, “_pred”, “_rc”, “_skip”, “_coef”, “byte”, “double”, “float”, “if”, “in”, “int”, “long”, “strL”, “using”, “with”, and “str#”

# Reading & Saving Stata Datasets

- Stata datasets are files with extension “dta”

    
- Stata reads and writes files to your “working directory”. 

    - To find out the current “working directory” type *pwd* or *cd*

    - To change the current “working directory”, use the File menu (File>Change Working Directory) or type *cd “path for new working directory”* 
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
pwd
cd
cd “c:/mystuff/project1/”
```   
    
    
---

# Reading Stata Datasets 

#### **From Your Computer**

- From a local directory

    - Use the menu (FILE->Open)
    
    - Use commands

```{r eval=FALSE}
clear
use auto
sysuse auto, clear
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
use “c:\stata\auto”
```

The quotation marks are not necessary, only if there are spaces in the names of files or directories.

---

# Reading Stata Datasets

#### **From Your Computer**

- From a different folder 

```{r eval=FALSE}
use “c:\mystuff\project1\auto”, clear
```

- Files that come with your Stata distribution (such as the auto.dta)  


```{r eval=FALSE}
sysuse auto
```

- Datasets that were installed with Stata

    - Check the menu item (File>Example Datasets…) 
    - Type *help dta_contents*
    - Go to the page “http://www.stata-press.com/data/”

    
---

# Reading Stata Datasets 

#### **From the Internet**

- with an url

```{r eval=FALSE}
use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r11/auto.dta
```


- for files located in the Stata website

```{r eval=FALSE}
webuse auto
```


---

# Reading Stata Datasets 

#### **Important Notes**

- You maybe be unable to read a (large) dataset for lack of memory. To increase memory issue the command (memory will be increased to 100 Mbytes):

```{r eval=FALSE}
set mem 100m
```

If you have Stata version 12 or later you no longer have to worry about this.

- If a file is in memory and you have modified it Stata will not allow you to overwrite it with another file unless you specify the “clear” option

```{r eval=FALSE}
clear
webuse
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
webuse auto, clear
```

---

# Saving Stata Datasets

- Use the menu (FILE->Save/FILE->Save As)

- Use commands

```{r eval=FALSE}
save nameofthefile
```

**Note:** Stata will not let you write over an existing file with the same file name. You need to add the “replace” option:

```{r eval=FALSE}
save nameofthefile, replace
```

- To save to a different folder 

```{r eval=FALSE}
save “c:\mystuff\project1\mydata”, replace
```


---

# Entering Data 

- Type *edit* will load the Data Editor which looks like a “spreadsheet”. 

- To import external ASCII files,

    - **insheet** for ﬁles containing one observation (on all variables) per line with variables separated by tabs or commas, where the ﬁrst line may contain the variable names; 
    
    - **infile with varlist** (free format) allows line breaks to occur anywhere and variables to be separated by spaces as well as commas or tabs;
    
    - **infile with a dictionary** (ﬁxed format) is the most ﬂexible command for reading data.
    
    - Data may be saved as ASCII using outfile or outsheet

- If you want to transfer files from other software you can always:

    - Use software to convert datasets (eg DBMS, Stat-Transfer) 
    
    - Write the file in ASCII and read it back into Stata

# Manipulating Data

### Variables
.font80[
- Variable Types: string and numeric

- Storage types: byte, int, long, ﬂoat, and double (numeric) and str1 to str2045 (string)

    - By default numeric variables are of the “float” type
    
    - Computers cannot store numbers with full precision. For more on this type help precision
    
    - If you worry about precision create variables of the “long” and “double” type.

- Variables can be associated with a name, a label, and a format.

- Type *help data types* for more information

- If you created a lot of variables (and are running out of space) you may want to issue the *compress* command, which will automatically convert the variables to their most adequate storage type.
]

# Manipulating Data

### Create a variable 

```{r eval=FALSE}
generate myvar=1
generate int myvar=1
generate double othervar=log(myvar)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
generate str5 newvar="No"
```

.font80[

**Notes**: 

1 - Missing values are represented by “.”. Stata think of a missing value as the largest possible number. You can code different types of missing values using Stata’s 27 numeric missing values (eg, “.a”, “.b”, “.c”, etc.)

2 - Dates are deﬁned as the number of days since 1/1/1960 and can be displayed using the date format %d. For example, the number 14976 will be displayed as 01jan2001 as long as the variable is formatted with “%d”.

3 - More complex functions are available through the **egen** command (extensions to generate).

# Modifying  Data

- To delete variables 

```{r eval=FALSE}
drop newvar myvar2 myvar3 myvar4
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
drop newvar myvar*
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
drop newvar myvar2-myvar4
```


- Alternatively, you can specify the variables to keep in the data set
```{r eval=FALSE}
sysuse auto, clear
keep  ma p mp r h tr w l tu d g for
```

---

# Modifying  Data

- To drop observations (drop if/keep if)

```{r eval=FALSE}
drop if mpg>35
keep if foreign==0
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
drop if foreign==1
```

- To modify selected values of a variables 

```{r eval=FALSE}
gen largecar=0
replace largecar =1 if weight>3500
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
recode mpg (1/20=1) (21/40=2)
```


**Note:** Stata uses one equal sign to assign values (eg. *generate myvar1=1*). Two equal signs are used to check for an equality.

# Manipulating Data

**Expressions**
.font90[
- Expressions involving variables are evaluated for each observation.

- There are logical, algebraic and string expressions in Stata. 

- Logical expressions: evaluate to 1 (true) or 0 (false) and use the operators < and <= for “less than” and “less than or equal to” respectively and similarly > and >= are used for “greater than” and “greater than or equal to”.

    - The symbols == and ~=/!= stand for “equal to” and “not equal to”, and the characters ~/!, & and | represent “not”, “and” and “or” respectively

    - *if (y ~= 2 & z > x) | x==1* means “if y is not equal to two and z is greater than x or if x equals one”.
]

---

# Manipulating Data

**Expressions**
.font90[
- Algebraic expressions: use the usual operators + - * / and ^ for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers respectively

- String expressions: mainly use special string functions such as substr(str,n1,n2) to extract a substring starting at n1 for a length of n2

    - The logical operators == and ~= are also allowed with string variables and the operator + concatenates two strings. 
    
]
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
display ("moon"+substr("sunlight",4,5))
```


**Note:** The commands preserve and restore can be used to implement temporary changes to your data

---

# Manipulating Data

**Indexes**
.font80[
- Each observation is associated with an index

    - For example, the value of the third observation on a particular variable x may be referred to as x[3]
    
    - The macro _n takes on the value of the running index and _N is equal to the number of observations. 
    
    - The previous observation of a variable can be referred as x[_n-1]
    
    - To refer to a range of observations
